#' synaptome.data: AnnotationHub version of Synaptome.DB
#'
#' The package provides access to the public copy of the Synaptic
#' proteome database. It was designed as an accompaniment for
#' \code{\link[synaptome.db]{synaptome.db}} package. Database provides
#' information for specific genes and allows building the protein-protein
#' interaction graph for gene sets, synaptic compartments, and brain regions.
#' not intended for direct access. All querying and analysis is supposed to
#' be performed via \code{\link[synaptome.db]{synaptome.db}} functionality.
