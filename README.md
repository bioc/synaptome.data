# synaptome.data
The package provides access to the copy of the Synaptic 
    proteome database. It was designed as an accompaniment for Synaptome.DB 
    package. Database provides information for specific synaptic genes and allows 
    building the protein-protein interaction graph for gene sets, synaptic 
    compartments, and brain regions. In the current update we added 6 more 
    synaptic proteome studies, which resulted in total of 64 studies. 
    We introduced Synaptic Vesicle as a separate compartment. We also added 
    coding mutations for Autistic Spectral disorder and Epilepsy collected 
    from publicly available databases.
