\title{synaptome.data: AnnotationHub version of Synaptome.DB}
\description{
The package provides access to the public copy of the Synaptic
proteome database. It was designed as an accompaniment for
\code{\link[synaptome.db]{synaptome.db}} package. Database provides
information for specific genes and allows building the protein-protein
interaction graph for gene sets, synaptic compartments, and brain regions.
not intended for direct access. All querying and analysis is supposed to
be performed via \code{\link[synaptome.db]{synaptome.db}} functionality.
